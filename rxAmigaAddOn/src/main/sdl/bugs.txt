Known bugs (see also todo.txt)
==============================

- Calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with SDL 1.3 several times makes it crash.

- Calling SDL_Init()/SDL_Quit() several times will make SDL 1.2 crash.

- SDL_FillRect() does not work with SDL 1.2 in HW mode (and probably with SDL 1.3 too).

- 32-bpp color mode does not work with SW video surface, 24-bpp and 32-bpp mode does not work with SDL_HWSURFACE.

Requested features, might never get implemented, see todo.txt for features that are going to be implemented
===========================================================================================================

- Select between normal mouse input and magnifying glass/relative input automatically, based on screen size.

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- Floating on-screen joystick - initially invisible, it appears when you touch the screen,
  centered on your finger, then it slides with your finger if you bump the joystick edge.

- Export phone vibrator to SDL - interface is available in SDL 1.3.

- Control screen brightness with SDL_SetGamma().

- Zoom in-out whole screen in SW mode with some SDL key or gesture, as in AndroidVNC.

- Support of libjnigraphics (it will disable on-screen keyboard, only SW SDL screen surface supported).
  This is not relevant already, as every device around is fast enough with GL.

- OpenArena: chat text input should be faster.

- OpenArena: Shift and Ctrl keys on USB keyboard do not work for text input.

- OpenArena: When entering with USB keyboard into chatbox, first 't' disappears.
