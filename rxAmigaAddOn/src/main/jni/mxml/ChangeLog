   * include/mxml_defs.h
   * src/mxml_node.c
      + Added element last_child in node structrure for faster mxml_add_below()
        execution. In documents with thousands of node this is a real boost.

   * src/mxml_attribute.c
      ! Fixed an error in reading last quote character

   * test/Makefile.am
   + test/testattrib.c
      + added a test for reading just an attribute and check it.

   * src/mxml_attribute.c
      ! fixed a possible error in escape parsing for attribute values.

2003-08-06 15:52 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai
   * configure.in
   + ltlib/Makefile.am
   + lib/Makefile.am
      ! Separate directories for shared and static library compilation

   * Added some missing file, and removed useless ones.

   * INSTALL
      ! Fixed some typos (thanks to Florian Schmidt)
   * include/mxml_defs.h
      ! Added macro for file read block (thanks to Florian Schmidt)

   * src/mxml_attribute.c
   * src/mxml_document.c
   * src/mxml_file.c
   * src/mxml_iterator.c
   * src/mxml_output.c
   * src/mxml_refil.c
      ! Fixed some typos and added check against NULL params in DEALLOCATOR
        macro calls (thanks to Florian Schmidt).

   * src/mxml_node.c
      ! Fixed some typos and mxml_node_insert_before/after (were not behaving
         correctly) (thanks to Florian Schmidt).

2003-07-09 00:51 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai
   + doc/Makefile.am
   - doc/Makefile.in
   * Makefile.am
     ! fixed MAKE DIST for doc files.

2003-06-30 20:20 UTC+0200 Giancarlo Niccolai
   ! INSTALL
      ! added automake -a to the compilation steps

   * include/mxml_defs.h
      + Added MXML_STYLE_NOESCAPE and MXML_ERROR_UNBALANCEDENTITY

   * include/mxml.h
   * include/mxml_file.h
   * src/mxml_attribute.c
   * src/mxml_error.c
   * src/mxml_file.c
   * src/mxml_node.c
   * src/mxml_output.c
      + Added support for escaping XML standard entities. This has required
        atting style parameter to many read functions; an output_string_escaped
        has been added to output module. Unescaping input is done inline while
        reading the file and parsing, making this operation lighter and faster,
        but a little more tricky to take as it is burned in the code.

   * test/mxml_test.c
   * test/test.xml
      + added tests for escaping chars.
